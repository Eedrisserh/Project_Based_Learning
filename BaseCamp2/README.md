# Welcome to My Basecamp 2
***

## Task
The task of this project is to continue building our Basecamp 1 app.
The goal is to add a messaging functionality where users can post messages,
reply to messages, and manage their messages effectively, and also to post and
manage attachment.

## Description
In this project, we have implemented a web application using Ruby on Rails framework.
The application allows users to perform various actions related to messages,
such as creating new messages, editing messages, replying to messages, and deleting messages and replies,
post and delete attachments. Users can also view a list of messages,
view individual messages with their replies, and navigate between different sections of the application.

To solve the problem, we have designed and implemented a database schema to store messages and replies,
created controllers to handle user actions, and developed views to display the appropriate content
to the users. We have also incorporated user authentication using the Devise gem
to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform certain actions on the messages and projects.

## Installation

Create a new message: Click on "New Message" and fill in the required information.
Edit a message: Click on "Edit" next to the message you want to edit.
Reply to a message: Scroll to the bottom of the message page and enter your reply in the provided text area.
Delete a message: Click on "Delete" next to the message you want to delete.
View a message: Click on the title of a message to view its content and replies.
Navigate between sections: Use the navigation links to access different sections of the application, such as the messages index page.
Add attachment to project: add by creating a new project or edit existing project
Remove attachment: Click on edit on project homepage and check the `remove attachment` checkbox
Please note that certain actions, such as editing or deleting messages,
may only be available to users with specific roles or permissions.
