# Welcome to My Levenshtein
***

## Task
The Task is to design a function that solves a Levenshtein problem.
Levenshtein proble compares two strings and returns the difference
between them.
## Description
I designed a function that accepts two strings,
Compare the length of the strings,
If they are not equal, the program returns -1,
Otherwise loop through the strings while comparing each element of the same index and counting the difference.

## Installation
The function does not require any special installation procedure,
It can be executed on any javascript interpreter with the "node" command on terminal.
The function must be called with two string arguments.

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_levenshtein(string1, string2)
